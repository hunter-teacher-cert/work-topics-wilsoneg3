I'd say the use of a neural network is necessary and ethical in larger class sizes such as MOOCs.  Although it may ultimately reduce the need for more teachers, perhaps teacher time that would have been spent grading could be spent doing something else.  One ethical concern is that it may reduce connection between teachers and students.  Another challenge to consider is that the grading tool cannot grade novel submissions.  This may be useful in assessing more simple forms of learning but would be a challenge for more summative pieces.
